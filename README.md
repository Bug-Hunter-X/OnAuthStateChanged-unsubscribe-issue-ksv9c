This repo contains a demonstration of a common issue encountered when using Firebase's onAuthStateChanged method.  The example shows how forgetting to unsubscribe from the listener can lead to memory leaks and unexpected behavior.  The solution demonstrates the proper method for unsubscribing to prevent these problems.  The bug and solution are clearly presented in separate JavaScript files.
